       Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy
      </h1>
      <p class="text-gray-400">
       Effective Date: September 29, 2025
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">
       1. General Principles
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
       As a service-based business, our work involves significant time and resources and cannot be "returned." The 50% deposit secures your project in our schedule and is used for initial project setup and resource allocation.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">
       2. Project Acceptance &amp; Final Sale
      </h2>
      <div class="bg-orange-500/10 border-l-4 border-orange-500/50 p-6 rounded-r-lg mb-6 not-prose">
       <p class="text-white font-semibold mb-2">
        Project Completion &amp; Acceptance:
       </p>
       <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 text-sm">
        A project is considered "complete" upon the electronic delivery of the final workflow file(s) and any accompanying documentation as specified in the Project Proposal. The 7-day review period commences from the time of this delivery. If no material defects are reported within this period, the project is considered formally accepted, and the final 50% payment becomes due. If Client identifies material issues within the review period, Silva Automation will have a "cure period" of 15 business days to remedy the reported issues.
        <strong>
         Upon project acceptance and receipt of the final 50% payment, the sale is considered final and no refunds will be issued.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </div>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">
       3. Cancellation by Client (Prior to Delivery)
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
       The Client may terminate this agreement at any point before the final delivery of the workflow by providing written notice. Upon such termination, the Client will be refunded fifty percent (50%) of the initial 50% deposit. The remaining portion of the deposit is retained by Silva Automation to cover administrative costs and work performed up to the point of cancellation.
      </p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">
       4. Refund Eligibility for Cause
      </h2>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
       A refund beyond the scope of Section 3 may be considered only if Silva Automation fails to correct a material defect within the 15-business-day cure period. A "material defect" is defined as a verifiable and reproducible failure of the delivered workflow to perform a core function as explicitly described and agreed upon in the Project Proposal; it does not include stylistic preferences or requests for features not originally specified. Refund requests must be submitted in writing. If approved, a partial or full refund will be considered based on the work completed. Approved refunds will be processed within 14 business days.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">
       Non-Refundable Costs:
      </h3>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
       Third-party subscriptions or licenses purchased on behalf of the client are never refundable.
