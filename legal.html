      <p>This website, www.silvaautomation.com (the "Site"), and the services offered through it, are owned and operated by Silva Automation. By accessing or using our Site and services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms").</p>

      <h3>1. Description of Services</h3>
      <p>Silva Automation provides business-to-business automation services, including workflow development, system integration, and process optimization. The specific scope of work for each project will be outlined in a separate Service Agreement and Project Proposal, which are incorporated into these Terms by reference.</p>

      <h3>2. Client Obligations</h3>
      <p>You agree to use our Site and services only for lawful purposes and in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. You agree to provide accurate, complete, and timely information, materials, and feedback necessary for the performance of the services. Client acknowledges that failure to do so may result in project delays or timeline extensions, for which Silva Automation shall not be held responsible.</p>

      <p><strong>Project Abandonment:</strong> If the Client fails to provide necessary feedback, materials, or communication for a continuous period of 30 days without prior notice, Silva Automation reserves the right to pause the project. If non-communication extends to 60 days, the project may be considered abandoned. In this event, the initial deposit will be forfeited, and all work completed to date will be billed at our standard hourly rate of $125/hour (plus GET), <strong>provided that the total amount due shall not exceed the original fixed project price unless otherwise agreed in writing</strong>.</p>

      <h3>3. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
      <p>Upon full and final payment by the Client, Silva Automation grants and assigns to the Client all right, title, and interest in the custom deliverables created specifically for the Client under the applicable Service Agreement ("Custom Work Product"). The Custom Work Product includes the final source code, workflow configurations, databases, and project documentation. <strong>Client may use the Custom Work Product for any internal business purpose without additional fees or royalties once paid in full.</strong></p>

      <p>Silva Automation retains ownership of all pre-existing intellectual property, including but not limited to proprietary tools, libraries, frameworks, methodologies, templates, know-how, and any code or materials not created specifically for the Client ("Pre-Existing IP"). Client is granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to use any Pre-Existing IP solely to the extent it is embedded in or necessary for the operation of the Custom Work Product.</p>

      <h3>4. Payments, Fees, and Hawaii General Excise Tax (GET)</h3>
      <p><strong>Payment Structure:</strong></p>

        <li>A <strong>50% deposit</strong> is due upon signing the Service Agreement before work begins</li>
        <li>A <strong>50% final payment</strong> is due upon project completion and delivery of all agreed-upon deliverables</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>Hawaii General Excise Tax (GET):</strong> As a business operating in Hawaii, we are required to collect Hawaii General Excise Tax (GET) at a rate of 4.5%. This will be added as a separate line item to all invoices.</p>

      <p><strong>Late Payments:</strong> Invoices not paid within 15 days of the due date will incur a late fee of 1.5% per month (18% annually) on the outstanding balance, to the extent permitted under Hawaii law. We reserve the right to suspend work on projects with overdue invoices exceeding 30 days and may pursue collection through legal channels if necessary.</p>

      <h3>5. Post-Delivery Support & Maintenance</h3>
      <p>Unless otherwise specified in your Service Agreement, all packages include <strong>90 days of free technical support</strong> from the date of project completion. <strong>If your Service Agreement specifies a different included support period, that written term controls over this standard 90-day period.</strong> During the included support period, Silva Automation will address bugs and integration issues stemming from the original implementation as delivered.</p>

      <p><strong>Support Exclusions:</strong> Support is strictly limited to the original workflow and systems as delivered. Silva Automation is not obligated to provide support, free or paid, for any issues arising from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Any modifications, additions, or tampering with the workflow configuration by the Client or any third party</li>
        <li>Changes to third-party applications, APIs, or platforms that affect the original integration</li>
        <li>Issues caused by Client-side errors, data input problems, or changes to connected accounts</li>
        <li>New features or functionality not included in the original scope of work</li>

      </ul>

      <p><strong>After the Included Support Period:</strong> Support beyond the included period is available at our current hourly rate of <strong>$125/hour</strong> (plus GET) or through an optional monthly support retainer.</p>

      <h4>5.1 Optional Monthly Support Retainer</h4>
      <p>For clients desiring ongoing support, Silva Automation offers a monthly retainer service. The specific services, hours, and fees will be detailed in a separate Retainer Agreement.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Services:</strong> May include proactive workflow monitoring, minor adjustments to existing workflows, data source management, priority support, and consultation on workflow optimization</li>
        <li><strong>Billing:</strong> The retainer fee is billed monthly in advance and is non-refundable for unused hours</li>
        <li><strong>Scope:</strong> The retainer does not cover development of new features, major workflow overhauls, or integration with new platforms, which will be quoted as separate projects</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> Can be cancelled by either party with 30 days' written notice</li>
      </ul>

Terms for this program will be detailed in the applicable Service Agreement. Any lifetime discount offered is contingent upon the Client's account remaining in good standing and shall terminate immediately upon material breach of these Terms, including non-payment of any invoice.</p>

      <h3>6. Client Credentials and Access</h3>
      <p>To deliver services, Silva Automation may require access to Client's third-party accounts and systems. Client agrees to provide necessary credentials and permissions in a timely manner and notify us immediately if credentials are changed or compromised.</p>

      <p>Silva Automation agrees to store all credentials securely using industry-standard encryption, use them only for the agreed-upon project scope, and delete them upon project completion unless ongoing support is contracted.</p>

      <p>Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Silva Automation from any and all claims, damages, and expenses arising from unauthorized access or data breach resulting from the use of Client-provided credentials, unless such breach is a direct result of Silva Automation's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Silva Automation agrees to comply with Hawaii's data breach notification requirements under HRS §487N in the event of a security incident involving Client's information.</p>

      <h3>7. Confidentiality</h3>
      <p>"Confidential Information" means any non-public information disclosed by one party to the other, whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information does not include information that is: (a) publicly known through no breach of this Agreement, (b) already in the receiving party's possession without breach of any obligation, (c) independently developed by the receiving party, or (d) rightfully received from a third party without restriction.</p>

      <p>Both parties agree to hold each other's Confidential Information in strict confidence, use it only for purposes of performing this Agreement, and not disclose it to third parties without prior written consent. This obligation of confidentiality shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years.</p>

      <h3>8. Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL SILVA AUTOMATION'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY CLIENT HEREUNDER IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE INCIDENT.</p>

        <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
      </div>

      <p>These limitations will not apply to liability resulting from Silva Automation's gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or data breaches caused by our failure to maintain reasonable security measures. Nothing in these Terms shall limit a party's liability which cannot be limited or excluded by applicable law, including rights under Hawaii's Unfair and Deceptive Acts or Practices (UDAP) laws (HRS Chapter 480).</p>

      <h3>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
      <p>Except as expressly stated in a signed Service Agreement, the services and information on this Site are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>

      <p>Silva Automation does not warrant that the services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure, or that defects will be corrected. We do not warrant or make any representations regarding the use or results of the services in terms of their correctness, accuracy, reliability, or otherwise.</p>

      <h3>10. Reliance on Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>Client acknowledges that the services provided may depend on the proper functioning of third-party platforms and services, including but not limited to n8n (self-hosted workflow orchestration), cloud infrastructure providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), and third-party applications and APIs (such as Zapier, Make.com, Google Workspace, CRMs, payment processors, and other integrations as specified in the Service Agreement). Silva Automation is not responsible for any service interruptions, data loss, security breaches, functionality changes, price increases, terms of service modifications, or failures caused by these third-party platforms.</p>

      <p>For self-hosted solutions deployed in Client's cloud environment, Client is responsible for maintaining the underlying infrastructure, including server uptime, security patches, backup systems, and cloud service subscriptions. Silva Automation's responsibility is limited to the automation workflows and configurations we deliver, not the infrastructure on which they run.</p>

      <p>Any issues originating from a third-party service, including API deprecations, feature removals, or platform shutdowns, are outside the scope of our support and liability. Client is responsible for maintaining appropriate subscriptions and licenses for all third-party services used in conjunction with our deliverables.</p>

      <h3>11. Indemnification</h3>
      <p>Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Silva Automation, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of: (a) Client's use of our services, (b) Client's violation of these Terms, (c) Client's violation of any third-party rights, including intellectual property rights or privacy rights, or (d) any content or data provided by Client.</p>

      <p>Silva Automation agrees to indemnify Client against claims that the Custom Work Product infringes any third-party intellectual property rights, provided Client promptly notifies Silva Automation of such claim and cooperates in the defense.</p>

      <h3>12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Hawaii, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>

      <h2>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h2>
      <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: October 7, 2025</p>

      <h3>1. General Principles</h3>
      <p>As a service-based business, our work involves significant time, expertise, and resources that cannot be "returned" like physical products. The 50% deposit secures your project in our schedule and covers initial project setup, discovery, planning, and resource allocation. This policy outlines the circumstances under which refunds may be issued.</p>

      <h3>2. Project Completion & Acceptance</h3>
      <p><strong>Project Delivery:</strong> A project is considered "complete" and ready for review upon electronic delivery of:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Final workflow file(s) and configurations</li>
        <li>Comprehensive documentation</li>
        <li>Access credentials (if applicable)</li>
        <li>Any other deliverables specified in the Project Proposal</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Review Period:</strong> Client has <strong>7 calendar days</strong> from delivery to review the project and report any material defects. The review period commences from the timestamp of the delivery email.</p>

      <p><strong>Material Defects Defined:</strong> A "material defect" is a verifiable, reproducible failure of the delivered workflow to perform a core function as explicitly described and agreed upon in the Project Proposal. Material defects do NOT include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stylistic preferences or subjective design choices</li>
        <li>Requests for features not originally specified in the Project Proposal</li>
        <li>Issues caused by changes to third-party platforms</li>
        <li>Performance expectations not explicitly documented</li>
        <li>Minor cosmetic issues that don't impact functionality</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Acceptance:</strong> If no material defects are reported within the 7-day review period, the project is considered formally accepted, and the final 50% payment becomes immediately due. Late payment terms apply as outlined in the Terms and Conditions.</p>

      <p><strong>Cure Period:</strong> If Client identifies and reports material defects within the 7-day review period, Silva Automation will have <strong>15 business days</strong> from receipt of the defect report to remedy the issues. If Silva Automation successfully resolves the material defects within this cure period, the project will be considered accepted upon delivery of the corrected version.</p>

      <p><strong>Final Sale:</strong> Upon project acceptance (either by passage of the review period or successful cure of defects) and receipt of the final 50% payment, the sale is considered final and <strong>no refunds will be issued</strong> except as specified in Section 4 below.</p>

      <h3>3. Cancellation by Client (Prior to Delivery)</h3>
      <p>Client may terminate the Service Agreement at any point before final delivery of the project by providing written notice to contact@silvaautomation.com.</p>

      <div class="highlight-box">
        <p><strong>Refund Terms:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client will receive a refund of <strong>25%</strong> of the total project value (equivalent to 50% of the deposit)</li>
          <li>Silva Automation retains <strong>25%</strong> of the total project value (the remaining 50% of the deposit) to cover administrative costs, project setup, planning time, and work performed to the point of cancellation</li>
          <li>Refunds will be processed within <strong>14 business days</strong> of receiving written cancellation notice</li>
          <li>Any third-party costs already incurred (licenses, subscriptions, paid tools) are non-refundable and will be deducted from any refund due</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>Example:</strong> For a $10,000 project with a $5,000 deposit:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Client receives $2,500 refund upon cancellation</li>
        <li>Silva Automation retains $2,500 of the deposit</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>4. Refund Eligibility for Cause (Post-Delivery)</h3>
      <p>A refund may be considered after delivery only in the following circumstances:</p>

      <p><strong>Uncured Material Defects:</strong> If Silva Automation fails to correct a verified material defect within the 15-business-day cure period after proper notification, Client may be eligible for a partial refund. The refund amount will be determined based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Severity and scope of the defect</li>
        <li>Percentage of project functionality affected</li>
        <li>Amount of work successfully completed</li>
        <li>Efforts made to resolve the issue</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Refund amounts typically range from 10% to 50% of the final payment, depending on the circumstances. Full refunds post-delivery are rare and reserved for complete failure to deliver usable functionality.</p>

      <p><strong>Request Process:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Submit a detailed written refund request to contact@silvaautomation.com</li>
        <li>Include specific documentation of the material defect(s)</li>
        <li>Provide evidence that the defect was reported within the 7-day review period</li>
        <li>Demonstrate that Silva Automation failed to cure within the 15-day cure period</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>Review Timeline:</strong> Silva Automation will review and respond to refund requests within <strong>10 business days</strong>. If approved, refunds will be processed within <strong>14 business days</strong> of approval.</p>

      <h3>5. Non-Refundable Costs</h3>
      <p>The following are never refundable under any circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Third-party software licenses or subscriptions purchased on behalf of the Client</li>
        <li>Third-party service fees (n8n hosting, cloud infrastructure, API costs, etc.)</li>
        <li>Payment processing fees</li>
        <li>Domain registration or hosting fees</li>
        <li>External consultant or contractor costs</li>
        <li>Training materials or sessions already delivered</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These costs will be itemized separately in your Project Proposal and will be deducted from any eligible refund.</p>

      <h3>6. Project Abandonment by Client</h3>
      <p>As outlined in the Terms and Conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>30-day pause:</strong> If Client fails to provide necessary feedback, materials, or communication for 30 continuous days without prior notice, Silva Automation reserves the right to pause the project</li>
        <li><strong>60-day abandonment:</strong> If non-communication extends to 60 days, the project may be considered abandoned</li>
        <li><strong>Upon abandonment:</strong> The initial deposit is forfeited in full, and all work completed to date will be billed at our standard hourly rate of $125/hour (plus GET), provided that the total amount due shall not exceed the original fixed project price unless otherwise agreed in writing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Client will receive a final invoice for work completed. No refunds will be issued for abandoned projects.</p>

      <h3>7. Refund Method</h3>
      <p>All approved refunds will be issued using the original payment method when possible. If the original payment method is no longer available, an alternative method will be arranged (ACH transfer or check). Refunds are issued in USD and exclude any currency conversion fees or international transfer fees.</p>

      <h3>8. Disputes</h3>
      <p>If Client disputes our refund determination, the matter shall be resolved according to the Dispute Resolution provisions in our Terms and Conditions, including good faith negotiation, mediation, and binding arbitration if necessary.</p>

      <h3>9. Exceptions and Special Circumstances</h3>
      <p>Silva Automation reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Documented medical emergencies</li>
        <li>Natural disasters or force majeure events</li>
        <li>Errors or misrepresentations by Silva Automation</li>
        <li>Mutual agreement to modify terms</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Any such exceptions must be approved in writing by Silva Automation management.</p>
