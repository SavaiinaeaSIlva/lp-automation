            <h3>1. Description of Services</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                Silva Automation provides business-to-business automation services, including workflow development, system integration, and process optimization. The specific scope of work for each project will be outlined in a separate Service Agreement and Project Proposal, which are incorporated into these Terms by reference.

            <h3>2. Client Obligations</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                You agree to use our Site and services only for lawful purposes and in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. You agree to provide accurate, complete, and timely information, materials, and feedback necessary for the performance of the services.

                <p class="text-subtle-text font-semibold text-light-text mb-2">Project Abandonment:</p>
                <p class="text-subtle-text text-sm">
                    If the Client fails to provide necessary feedback, materials, or communication for a continuous period of 30 days without prior notice, Silva Automation reserves the right to pause the project. If non-communication extends to 60 days, the project may be considered abandoned. In this event, the initial deposit will be forfeited, and all work completed to date will be billed at our standard hourly rate.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>3. Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                Upon full and final payment by the Client, Silva Automation grants and assigns to the Client all right, title, and interest in the custom deliverables created specifically for the Client under the applicable Service Agreement ("Custom Work Product"). The Custom Work Product includes the final source code, workflow configurations, databases, and project documentation.
            </p>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                Silva Automation retains ownership of all pre-existing intellectual property, including but not limited to proprietary tools, libraries, frameworks, methodologies, templates, know-how, and any code or materials not created specifically for the Client ("Pre-Existing IP"). Client is granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to use any Pre-Existing IP solely to the extent it is embedded in or necessary for the operation of the Custom Work Product.

            </p>

            <h3>5. Post-Delivery Support & Maintenance</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                All packages include 30 days of free technical support from the date of project completion. During this period, Silva Automation will address bugs and integration issues stemming from the original implementation as delivered.
            </p>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-4"><strong>Support Exclusions:</strong> Support is strictly limited to the original workflow and systems as delivered. Silva Automation is not obligated to provide support, free or paid, for any issues arising from:</p>
            <ul class="text-subtle-text">

            <h4>5.2 Founding Client Program - Special Terms</h4>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                Silva Automation may offer a limited Founding Client Program with special pricing and extended support terms. Terms for this program will be detailed in the applicable Service Agreement. Any lifetime discount offered is contingent upon the Client's account remaining in good standing and shall terminate immediately upon material breach of these Terms, including non-payment of any invoice.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Client Credentials and Access</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                To deliver services, Silva Automation may require access to Client's third-party accounts and systems. Client agrees to provide necessary credentials and permissions in a timely manner and notify us immediately if credentials are changed or compromised.
            </p>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                Silva Automation agrees to store all credentials securely using industry-standard encryption, use them only for the agreed-upon project scope, and delete them upon project completion unless ongoing support is contracted.
            </p>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Silva Automation from any and all claims, damages, and expenses arising from unauthorized access or data breach resulting from the use of Client-provided credentials, unless such breach is a direct result of Silva Automation's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Silva Automation agrees to comply with Hawaii's data breach notification requirements under HRS §487N in the event of a security incident involving Client's information.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Confidentiality</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                "Confidential Information" means any non-public information disclosed by one party to the other, whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information does not include information that is: (a) publicly known through no breach of this Agreement, (b) already in the receiving party's possession without breach of any obligation, (c) independently developed by the receiving party, or (d) rightfully received from a third party without restriction.
            </p>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                Both parties agree to hold each other's Confidential Information in strict confidence, use it only for purposes of performing this Agreement, and not disclose it to third parties without prior written consent. This obligation of confidentiality shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Limitation of Liability</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text uppercase font-medium">
                IN NO EVENT SHALL SILVA AUTOMATION'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY CLIENT HEREUNDER IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE INCIDENT.
            </p>
            <p class="text-subtle-text uppercase font-medium mt-2">
                IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
            </p>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                These limitations will not apply to liability resulting from Silva Automation's gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or data breaches caused by our failure to maintain reasonable security measures. Nothing in these Terms shall limit a party's liability which cannot be limited or excluded by applicable law, including rights under Hawaii's Unfair and Deceptive Acts or Practices (UDAP) laws (HRS Chapter 480).
            </p>

            <h3>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                Except as expressly stated in a signed Service Agreement, the services and information on this Site are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                Silva Automation does not warrant that the services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure, or that defects will be corrected.

            </p>

            <h3>10. Reliance on Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                Client acknowledges that the services provided are dependent on the proper functioning of third-party platforms and services (e.g., Make.com, Zapier, Google Workspace, CRMs, APIs). Silva Automation is not responsible for any service interruptions, data loss, security breaches, functionality changes, price increases, terms of service modifications, or failures caused by these third-party platforms.
            </p>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                Any issues originating from a third-party service, including API deprecations, feature removals, or platform shutdowns, are outside the scope of our support and liability. Client is responsible for maintaining appropriate subscriptions and licenses for all third-party services used in conjunction with our deliverables.
            </p>

            <h3>11. Indemnification</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Silva Automation, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of: (a) Client's use of our services, (b) Client's violation of these Terms, (c) Client's violation of any third-party rights, including intellectual property rights or privacy rights, or (d) any content or data provided by Client.
            </p>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                Silva Automation agrees to indemnify Client against claims that the Custom Work Product infringes any third-party intellectual property rights, provided Client promptly notifies Silva Automation of such claim and cooperates in the defense.
            </p>

            <h3>12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Hawaii, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
            </p>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof shall be resolved as follows:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-subtle-text">
                <li><strong>Negotiation:</strong> The parties shall first attempt to negotiate a resolution in good faith for a period of 30 days</li>
                <li><strong>Mediation:</strong> If negotiation fails, the parties agree to participate in mediation administered by a mutually agreed-upon mediator in Honolulu, Hawaii</li>
                <li><strong>Arbitration:</strong> If mediation is unsuccessful, the dispute shall be resolved by mandatory, binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Honolulu, Hawaii, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                The parties hereby waive their right to a jury trial and agree not to participate in any class action lawsuits. Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees unless the arbitrator determines otherwise.
            </p>

            <h3>13. Termination</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                Either party may terminate a Service Agreement for cause upon 30 days' written notice if the other party materially breaches these Terms and fails to cure such breach within the notice period.
            </p>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                Silva Automation may suspend services immediately for non-payment exceeding 15 days or for Client's breach of confidentiality obligations. Upon termination, Client shall immediately pay for all work completed to date based on the percentage of project completion or hourly rates, whichever is applicable.
            </p>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                Client's rights to terminate for convenience are outlined in the Refund & Cancellation Policy. Upon termination, all licenses granted to Client shall terminate except for the Custom Work Product for which full payment has been received.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold font-display text-light-text mb-6 border-b border-gray-800 pb-4">Refund & Cancellation Policy</h2>
            <p class="text-sm text-subtle-text mb-6">Effective Date: October 7, 2025</p>

            <p class="text-subtle-text mb-6">
                This policy outlines the conditions for refunds and cancellations related to services provided by Silva Automation. By engaging our services, you agree to this policy.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Project Deposits and Initial Payments</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                All projects require a <strong>50% non-refundable deposit</strong> upon signing the Service Agreement to secure the project timeline and cover initial resource allocation, planning, and setup fees. Work will not commence until this deposit is received.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Cancellation by Client Before Commencement</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                If the Client cancels a Service Agreement <em>after</em> paying the deposit but <em>before</em> work has formally commenced (as defined by the start date in the Service Agreement), the <strong>50% deposit remains non-refundable</strong> and will be retained by Silva Automation as a cancellation fee.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Cancellation by Client After Commencement</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                If the Client cancels a Service Agreement *after* work has commenced:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-subtle-text">
                <li>The <strong>initial 50% deposit is forfeited</strong> and converted to a cancellation fee.</li>
                <li>The Client is immediately <strong>liable for all work completed</strong> up to the date of written cancellation, calculated at our standard hourly rate of <strong>$125/hour (plus GET)</strong>, or the pro-rata portion of the fixed fee based on estimated project completion, whichever is greater.</li>
                <li>If the value of the completed work exceeds the initial 50% deposit, the Client will be invoiced for the difference, payable within 7 days.</li>
                <li>If the value of the completed work is less than the initial 50% deposit, no refund will be issued.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-subtle-text mt-2">
                All outstanding invoices become immediately due and payable upon cancellation.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Project Abandonment</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                As detailed in the Terms and Conditions, if a project is deemed abandoned (60 days of non-communication), the initial deposit is forfeited, and all work completed to date will be billed at the standard hourly rate. No refunds are available for abandoned projects.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Completion and Final Payment</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                Upon project completion and delivery of all agreed-upon Custom Work Product, the <strong>final 50% payment is due and is non-refundable.</strong> Acceptance of the deliverables constitutes final sign-off, and no refunds are available thereafter.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Exceptions (Cancellation by Silva Automation)</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                If Silva Automation is required to cancel a project for reasons other than the Client's breach of contract (e.g., unexpected capacity issues, or inability to complete the work as initially scoped):
            </p>
            <ul class="text-subtle-text">
                <li>The Client will be immediately refunded the unused portion of the funds paid, minus the value of work completed to date, calculated at our standard hourly rate.</li>
                <li>Silva Automation will, where possible, provide all work completed up to the date of cancellation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>7. Support and Retainer Services</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                Monthly Support Retainer fees are billed in advance and are <strong>non-refundable</strong> for unused hours within that month. Cancellation of the Retainer requires 30 days' written notice, after which future monthly billing will cease. No refunds will be provided for past retainer fees.
            </p>

            <h3>8. Dispute Resolution</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">
                Any claims for refunds must be made in writing. If a dispute over the amount owed or work completed cannot be resolved through negotiation, the dispute will be escalated according to the dispute resolution procedure outlined in the Terms and Conditions (Section 12), beginning with mediation in Honolulu, Hawaii.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Contact Information</h3>
            <p class="text-subtle-text">For refund and cancellation inquiries, please contact:</p>
