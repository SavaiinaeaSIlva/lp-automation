        <p class="text-gray-400">Effective Date: October 7, 2025</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">This website, www.silvaautomation.com (the "Site"), and the services offered through it, are owned and operated by Silva Automation. By accessing or using our Site and services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms").</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">1. Description of Services</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Silva Automation provides business-to-business automation services, including workflow development, system integration, and process optimization. The specific scope of work for each project will be outlined in a separate Service Agreement and Project Proposal, which are incorporated into these Terms by reference.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">2. Client Obligations</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">You agree to use our Site and services only for lawful purposes and in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local laws. You agree to provide accurate, complete, and timely information, materials, and feedback necessary for the performance of the services. Client acknowledges that failure to do so may result in project delays or timeline extensions, for which Silva Automation shall not be held responsible.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong>Project Abandonment:</strong> If the Client fails to provide necessary feedback, materials, or communication for a continuous period of 30 days without prior notice, Silva Automation reserves the right to pause the project. If non-communication extends to 60 days, the project may be considered abandoned. In this event, the initial deposit will be forfeited, and all work completed to date will be billed at our standard hourly rate.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">3. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Upon full and final payment by the Client, Silva Automation grants and assigns to the Client all right, title, and interest in the custom deliverables created specifically for the Client under the applicable Service Agreement ("Custom Work Product"). The Custom Work Product includes the final source code, workflow configurations, databases, and project documentation.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Silva Automation retains ownership of all pre-existing intellectual property, including but not limited to proprietary tools, libraries, frameworks, methodologies, templates, know-how, and any code or materials not created specifically for the Client ("Pre-Existing IP"). Client is granted a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual license to use any Pre-Existing IP solely to the extent it is embedded in or necessary for the operation of the Custom Work Product.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">4. Payments, Fees, and Hawaii General Excise Tax (GET)</h2>

We reserve the right to suspend work on projects with overdue invoices exceeding 30 days and may pursue collection through legal channels if necessary.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">5. Post-Delivery Support &amp; Maintenance</h2>

            <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> Can be cancelled by either party with 30 days' written notice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">5.2 Founding Client Program - Special Terms</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Silva Automation may offer a limited Founding Client Program with special pricing and extended support terms. Terms for this program will be detailed in the applicable Service Agreement. Any lifetime discount offered is contingent upon the Client's account remaining in good standing and shall terminate immediately upon material breach of these Terms, including non-payment of any invoice.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">6. Client Credentials and Access</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">To deliver services, Silva Automation may require access to Client's third-party accounts and systems. Client agrees to provide necessary credentials and permissions in a timely manner and notify us immediately if credentials are changed or compromised.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Silva Automation agrees to store all credentials securely using industry-standard encryption, use them only for the agreed-upon project scope, and delete them upon project completion unless ongoing support is contracted.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Silva Automation from any and all claims, damages, and expenses arising from unauthorized access or data breach resulting from the use of Client-provided credentials, unless such breach is a direct result of Silva Automation's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Silva Automation agrees to comply with Hawaii's data breach notification requirements under HRS ¬ß487N in the event of a security incident involving Client's information.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">7. Confidentiality</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">"Confidential Information" means any non-public information disclosed by one party to the other, whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information does not include information that is: (a) publicly known through no breach of this Agreement, (b) already in the receiving party's possession without breach of any obligation, (c) independently developed by the receiving party, or (d) rightfully received from a third party without restriction.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Both parties agree to hold each other's Confidential Information in strict confidence, use it only for purposes of performing this Agreement, and not disclose it to third parties without prior written consent. This obligation of confidentiality shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">IN NO EVENT SHALL SILVA AUTOMATION'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY CLIENT HEREUNDER IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE INCIDENT.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">These limitations will not apply to liability resulting from Silva Automation's gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud, or data breaches caused by our failure to maintain reasonable security measures. Nothing in these Terms shall limit a party's liability which cannot be limited or excluded by applicable law, including rights under Hawaii's Unfair and Deceptive Acts or Practices (UDAP) laws (HRS Chapter 480).</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Except as expressly stated in a signed Service Agreement, the services and information on this Site are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Silva Automation does not warrant that the services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or completely secure, or that defects will be corrected. We do not warrant or make any representations regarding the use or results of the services in terms of their correctness, accuracy, reliability, or otherwise.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">10. Reliance on Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Client acknowledges that the services provided are dependent on the proper functioning of third-party platforms and services (e.g., Make.com, Zapier, Google Workspace, CRMs, APIs). Silva Automation is not responsible for any service interruptions, data loss, security breaches, functionality changes, price increases, terms of service modifications, or failures caused by these third-party platforms.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Any issues originating from a third-party service, including API deprecations, feature removals, or platform shutdowns, are outside the scope of our support and liability. Client is responsible for maintaining appropriate subscriptions and licenses for all third-party services used in conjunction with our deliverables.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">11. Indemnification</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Silva Automation, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of: (a) Client's use of our services, (b) Client's violation of these Terms, (c) Client's violation of any third-party rights, including intellectual property rights or privacy rights, or (d) any content or data provided by Client.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Silva Automation agrees to indemnify Client against claims that the Custom Work Product infringes any third-party intellectual property rights, provided Client promptly notifies Silva Automation of such claim and cooperates in the defense.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Hawaii, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof shall be resolved as follows:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Negotiation:</strong> The parties shall first attempt to negotiate a resolution in good faith for a period of 30 days.</li>
            <li><strong>Mediation:</strong> If negotiation fails, the parties agree to participate in mediation administered by a mutually agreed-upon mediator in Honolulu, Hawaii.</li>
            <li><strong>Arbitration:</strong> If mediation is unsuccessful, the dispute shall be resolved by mandatory, binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration shall take place in Honolulu, Hawaii, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">The parties hereby waive their right to a jury trial and agree not to participate in any class action lawsuits. Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees unless the arbitrator determines otherwise.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">13. Termination</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Either party may terminate a Service Agreement for cause upon 30 days' written notice if the other party materially breaches these Terms and fails to cure such breach within the notice period.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Silva Automation may suspend services immediately for non-payment exceeding 15 days or for Client's breach of confidentiality obligations. Upon termination, Client shall immediately pay for all work completed to date based on the percentage of project completion or hourly rates, whichever is applicable.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Client's rights to terminate for convenience are outlined in the Refund & Cancellation Policy. Upon termination, all licenses granted to Client shall terminate except for the Custom Work Product for which full payment has been received.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">14. Force Majeure</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to events beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, government actions, labor disputes, widespread internet or power outages, pandemics, or failures of third-party hosting or service providers. The affected party shall notify the other party promptly and use reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact. If the force majeure event continues for more than 60 days, either party may terminate the affected Service Agreement.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">15. General Provisions</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Assignment:</strong> Neither party may assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Silva Automation may assign to an affiliated entity or in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of substantially all assets.</li>

        <h1 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Refund &amp; Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <p class="text-gray-400">Effective Date: October 7, 2025</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">1. General Principles</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">As a service-based business, our work involves significant time, expertise, and resources that cannot be "returned" like physical products. The 50% deposit secures your project in our schedule and covers initial project setup, discovery, planning, and resource allocation. This policy outlines the circumstances under which refunds may be issued.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">2. Project Completion &amp; Acceptance</h2>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Project Delivery:</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">A project is considered "complete" and ready for review upon electronic delivery of:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Final workflow file(s) and configurations</li>
            <li>Comprehensive documentation</li>
            <li>Access credentials (if applicable)</li>
            <li>Any other deliverables specified in the Project Proposal</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Review Period:</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Client has 7 calendar days from delivery to review the project and report any material defects. The review period commences from the timestamp of the delivery email.</p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Material Defects Defined:</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">A "material defect" is a verifiable, reproducible failure of the delivered workflow to perform a core function as explicitly described and agreed upon in the Project Proposal. Material defects do NOT include:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Stylistic preferences or subjective design choices</li>
            <li>Requests for features not originally specified in the Project Proposal</li>
            <li>Issues caused by changes to third-party platforms</li>
            <li>Performance expectations not explicitly documented</li>
            <li>Minor cosmetic issues that don't impact functionality</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Acceptance:</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If no material defects are reported within the 7-day review period, the project is considered formally accepted, and the final 50% payment becomes immediately due. Late payment terms apply as outlined in the Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Cure Period:</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If Client identifies and reports material defects within the 7-day review period, Silva Automation will have 15 business days from receipt of the defect report to remedy the issues. If Silva Automation successfully resolves the material defects within this cure period, the project will be considered accepted upon delivery of the corrected version.</p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Final Sale:</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Upon project acceptance (either by passage of the review period or successful cure of defects) and receipt of the final 50% payment, the sale is considered final and no refunds will be issued except as specified in Section 4 below.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">3. Cancellation by Client (Prior to Delivery)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Client may terminate the Service Agreement at any point before final delivery of the project by providing written notice to contact@silvaautomation.com.</p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Refund Terms:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Client will receive a refund of 25% of the total project value (equivalent to 50% of the deposit)</li>
            <li>Silva Automation retains 25% of the total project value (the remaining 50% of the deposit) to cover administrative costs, project setup, planning time, and work performed to the point of cancellation</li>
            <li>Refunds will be processed within 14 business days of receiving written cancellation notice</li>
            <li>Any third-party costs already incurred (licenses, subscriptions, paid tools) are non-refundable and will be deducted from any refund due</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong>Example:</strong> For a $10,000 project with a $5,000 deposit: Client receives $2,500 refund upon cancellation; Silva Automation retains $2,500 of the deposit.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">4. Refund Eligibility for Cause (Post-Delivery)</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">A refund may be considered after delivery only in the following circumstances:</p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Uncured Material Defects:</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">If Silva Automation fails to correct a verified material defect within the 15-business-day cure period after proper notification, Client may be eligible for a partial refund. The refund amount will be determined based on:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Severity and scope of the defect</li>
            <li>Percentage of project functionality affected</li>
            <li>Amount of work successfully completed</li>
            <li>Efforts made to resolve the issue</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">Refund amounts typically range from 10% to 50% of the final payment, depending on the circumstances. Full refunds post-delivery are rare and reserved for complete failure to deliver usable functionality.</p>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Request Process:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Submit a detailed written refund request to contact@silvaautomation.com</li>
            <li>Include specific documentation of the material defect(s)</li>
            <li>Provide evidence that the defect was reported within the 7-day review period</li>
            <li>Demonstrate that Silva Automation failed to cure within the 15-day cure period</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Review Timeline:</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Silva Automation will review and respond to refund requests within 10 business days. If approved, refunds will be processed within 14 business days of approval.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">5. Non-Refundable Costs</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">The following are never refundable under any circumstances:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Third-party software licenses or subscriptions purchased on behalf of the Client</li>
            <li>Third-party service fees (Make.com, Zapier, API costs, etc.)</li>
            <li>Payment processing fees</li>
            <li>Domain registration or hosting fees</li>
            <li>External consultant or contractor costs</li>
            <li>Training materials or sessions already delivered</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">These costs will be itemized separately in your Project Proposal and will be deducted from any eligible refund.</p>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">6. Project Abandonment by Client</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">As outlined in the Terms and Conditions:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>30-day pause:</strong> If Client fails to provide necessary feedback, materials, or communication for 30 continuous days without prior notice, Silva Automation reserves the right to pause the project</li>
            <li><strong>60-day abandonment:</strong> If non-communication extends to 60 days, the project may be considered abandoned</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">Upon abandonment: The initial deposit is forfeited in full, and all work completed to date will be billed at our standard hourly rate of $125/hour (plus GET), which may exceed the remaining project balance.
