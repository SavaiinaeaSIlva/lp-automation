## Silva Automation - Landing Page ##
This repository contains the source code for the official landing page for Silva Automation, a consultancy service offering "done-for-you" business automation solutions for service-based businesses.

About The Project
Silva Automation helps service business owners save time and increase revenue by building custom automation workflows. This landing page serves as the primary marketing and lead-generation tool for the business. It is designed to clearly communicate the value proposition, build trust through a compelling personal story, and convert visitors into leads through a simple consultation booking process.

The business model pivoted from a SaaS subscription to a "done-for-you" consultancy service, and this website reflects that change by offering one-time setup packages instead of monthly plans.

Tech Stack
This is a simple, fast, and responsive static website built with modern front-end technologies.

HTML5: For the core structure and content.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.

AOS (Animate On Scroll): A lightweight library for subtle scroll animations.

Formspree: For easy HTML form processing without a backend server.

Key Features
Compelling Value Proposition: The copy is focused on solving a core pain point for service businesses: losing money and time on manual processes and no-shows.

Credibility-Driven Story: The "About" section leverages the founder's real-world experience running a service business to build instant trust and rapport.
