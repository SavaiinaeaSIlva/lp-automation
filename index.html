                    <details>
                        <summary>Is this system complicated to use?</summary>
                        <p>Not at all. We design our systems to be operated entirely from your smartphone. You'll receive simple text notifications for new leads and updates, while the automation runs seamlessly in the background.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Is this service a good fit for a solo operation?</summary>
                        <p>Absolutely. Our systems are particularly effective for solo contractors, acting as a virtual assistant to ensure you never miss a lead, even when you're on a job.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Can the system be customized for specific needs, like rain delays?</summary>
                        <p>Yes. We can build custom features, such as a "Rain Delay" function that automatically notifies and reschedules all of your appointments for the day with a single tap.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>How is this different from lead generation services like Angi?</summary>
                        <p>Unlike platforms that sell the same lead to multiple contractors, our systems are designed to capture and convert the exclusive leads you generate through your own marketing and referrals.</p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>What is your pricing model?</summary>
                        <p>We build and implement custom systems for a one-time project fee. You own the solution outright, with no recurring monthly fees required to maintain your data or system access.</p>
