                        <p>Aloha, I’m Savaiinaea “Naea” Silva. Before I ever automated a workflow, I was running a service business right here in Hawaii. I know the burnout. I remember the long days and late nights, feeling like I was spending more time on paperwork and scheduling than on the actual work I was passionate about.</p>
                        <p>I knew there had to be a better way. That’s why I started Silva Automation. My mission is to help fellow Hawaii business owners win back their most valuable asset: their time. I build custom systems that handle the busywork, so you can get back to focusing on your craft, serving your clients, and being present with your family.</p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h4 class="faq-subheader">The Value & The Results</h4>
            <details>
                <summary>What kind of businesses do you work with?</summary>
                <p>We specialize in helping Hawaii-based service businesses (e.g., junk removal, landscaping, cleaning services, contractors). If you're feeling buried in administrative work, we can build a system for you.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What problems do you solve?</summary>
                <p>We solve the feeling of being overwhelmed and trapped by your own business. If you're spending nights and weekends on admin tasks, losing track of new leads, or feel like you can't step away without things falling apart, we build the systems that run those tasks for you, automatically.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What results can I realistically expect?</summary>
                <p>Our clients experience four key results: Freedom (more time), Scalability (growth without more hiring), Professionalism (five-star client experiences), and Peace of Mind (your business runs 24/7).</p>
            </details>

            <h4 class="faq-subheader">The Process & The Partnership</h4>
            <details>
                <summary>What's the process from start to finish?</summary>
                <p>Most projects are designed, built, and delivered within 7-14 days. After our initial call, we map out your exact needs, build the custom system, then deliver the finished product and train you and your team.</p>
            </details>
             <details>
                <summary>What does the training and handover look like?</summary>
                <p>This is our local advantage. If your business is on Oahu or any of the neighbor islands, we come to you. We provide in-person, hands-on training for you and your key staff to ensure everyone is confident using the new system.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>Is this a monthly subscription?</summary>
                <p>No. Our automation packages are a one-time investment. Once we build your system, you own it outright.</p>
            </details>
             <details>
                <summary>What isn't included in my project?</summary>
                <p>Our service is focused on building your automation system. We are not Virtual Assistants (VAs)—the systems run themselves, but we don't perform the daily tasks for you. The project fee also does not include the separate subscription costs for any software you use (like your CRM, etc.).</p>
            </details>

            <h4 class="faq-subheader">Support & Technical Questions</h4>
            <details>
                <summary>What tools do you use?</summary>
                <p>We primarily use powerful, flexible platforms like n8n. This allows us to create robust automations that can be self-hosted, which keeps your long-term costs low and gives you full ownership of your data.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What support is included with a standard project?</summary>
                <p>Every project includes a 90-day support window to fix any bugs or issues that arise with the original system we built for you.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary>What does "1 Year of Premium Support" include?</summary>
                <p>Our Founding Clients receive an all-inclusive support package for a full year: bug fixes, troubleshooting, up to one hour of tweaks per month, and on-call access for when you need help.</p>

            <p>Silva Automation may suspend services immediately for non-payment exceeding 15 days or for Client's breach of confidentiality obligations. Upon termination, Client shall immediately pay for all work completed to date based on the percentage of project completion or hourly rates, whichever is applicable.</p>

            <h2>14. Force Majeure</h2>
            <p>Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance due to events beyond their reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism, government actions, labor disputes, widespread internet or power outages, pandemics, or failures of third-party hosting or service providers. The affected party shall notify the other party promptly and use reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact. If the force majeure event continues for more than 60 days, either party may terminate the affected Service Agreement.</p>

            <h2>2. Project Completion & Acceptance</h2>
            <h3>Project Delivery:</h3>
            <p>A project is considered "complete" and ready for review upon electronic delivery of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Final workflow file(s) and configurations</li>
                <li>Comprehensive documentation</li>
                <li>Access credentials (if applicable)</li>
                <li>Any other deliverables specified in the Project Proposal</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Review Period:</h3>
            <p>Client has 7 calendar days from delivery to review the project and report any material defects. The review period commences from the timestamp of the delivery email.</p>
            <h3>Material Defects Defined:</h3>
            <p>A "material defect" is a verifiable, reproducible failure of the delivered workflow to perform a core function as explicitly described and agreed upon in the Project Proposal. Material defects do NOT include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stylistic preferences or subjective design choices</li>
                <li>Requests for features not originally specified in the Project Proposal</li>
                <li>Issues caused by changes to third-party platforms</li>
                <li>Performance expectations not explicitly documented</li>
                <li>Minor cosmetic issues that don't impact functionality</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Acceptance:</h3>
            <p>If no material defects are reported within the 7-day review period, the project is considered formally accepted, and the final 50% payment becomes immediately due. Late payment terms apply as outlined in the Terms and Conditions.</p>
            <h3>Cure Period:</h3>
            <p>If Client identifies and reports material defects within the 7-day review period, Silva Automation will have 15 business days from receipt of the defect report to remedy the issues. If Silva Automation successfully resolves the material defects within this cure period, the project will be considered accepted upon delivery of the corrected version.</p>
            <h3>Final Sale:</h3>
            <p>Upon project acceptance (either by passage of the review period or successful cure of defects) and receipt of the final 50% payment, the sale is considered final and no refunds will be issued except as specified in Section 4 below.</p>
            <h2>3. Cancellation by Client (Prior to Delivery)</h2>
            <p>Client may terminate the Service Agreement at any point before final delivery of the project by providing written notice to contact@silvaautomation.com.</p>
            <h3>Refund Terms:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Client will receive a refund of 25% of the total project value (equivalent to 50% of the deposit)</li>
                <li>Silva Automation retains 25% of the total project value (the remaining 50% of the deposit) to cover administrative costs, project setup, planning time, and work performed to the point of cancellation</li>
                <li>Refunds will be processed within 14 business days of receiving written cancellation notice</li>
                <li>Any third-party costs already incurred (licenses, subscriptions, paid tools) are non-refundable and will be deducted from any refund due</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> For a $10,000 project with a $5,000 deposit: Client receives $2,500 refund upon cancellation; Silva Automation retains $2,500 of the deposit.</p>
            <h2>4. Refund Eligibility for Cause (Post-Delivery)</h2>
            <p>A refund may be considered after delivery only in the following circumstances:</p>
            <h3>Uncured Material Defects:</h3>
            <p>If Silva Automation fails to correct a verified material defect within the 15-business-day cure period after proper notification, Client may be eligible for a partial refund. The refund amount will be determined based on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Severity and scope of the defect</li>
                <li>Percentage of project functionality affected</li>
                <li>Amount of work successfully completed</li>
                <li>Efforts made to resolve the issue</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Refund amounts typically range from 10% to 50% of the final payment, depending on the circumstances. Full refunds post-delivery are rare and reserved for complete failure to deliver usable functionality.</p>
            <h3>Request Process:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Submit a detailed written refund request to contact@silvaautomation.com</li>
                <li>Include specific documentation of the material defect(s)</li>
                <li>Provide evidence that the defect was reported within the 7-day review period</li>
                <li>Demonstrate that Silva Automation failed to cure within the 15-day cure period</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Review Timeline:</h3>
            <p>Silva Automation will review and respond to refund requests within 10 business days. If approved, refunds will be processed within 14 business days of approval.</p>
            <h2>5. Non-Refundable Costs</h2>
            <p>The following are never refundable under any circumstances:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Third-party software licenses or subscriptions purchased on behalf of the Client</li>
                <li>Third-party service fees (Make.com, Zapier, API costs, etc.)</li>
                <li>Payment processing fees</li>
                <li>Domain registration or hosting fees</li>
                <li>External consultant or contractor costs</li>
                <li>Training materials or sessions already delivered</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These costs will be itemized separately in your Project Proposal and will be deducted from any eligible refund.</p>
            <h2>6. Project Abandonment by Client</h2>
            <p>As outlined in the Terms and Conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>30-day pause:</strong> If Client fails to provide necessary feedback, materials, or communication for 30 continuous days without prior notice, Silva Automation reserves the right to pause the project</li>
                <li><strong>60-day abandonment:</strong> If non-communication extends to 60 days, the project may be considered abandoned</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Upon abandonment: The initial deposit is forfeited in full, and all work completed to date will be billed at our standard hourly rate of $125/hour (plus GET), which may exceed the remaining project balance. Client will receive a final invoice for work completed. No refunds will be issued for abandoned projects.</p>
            <h2>7. Refund Method</h2>
            <p>All approved refunds will be issued using the original payment method when possible. If the original payment method is no longer available, an alternative method will be arranged (ACH transfer or check). Refunds are issued in USD and exclude any currency conversion fees or international transfer fees.</p>
            <h2>8. Disputes</h2>
            <p>If Client disputes our refund determination, the matter shall be resolved according to the Dispute Resolution provisions in our Terms and Conditions, including good faith negotiation, mediation, and binding arbitration if necessary.</p>
            <h2>9. Exceptions and Special Circumstances</h2>
            <p>Silva Automation reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to:</p>
