                    <p class="text-gray-400">Effective Date: September 3, 2025</p>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">This Refund & Cancellation Policy outlines the conditions under which Silva Automation ("we," "us," or "our") provides refunds and allows for the cancellation of services. This policy is governed by Hawaii state law and incorporates fair business practices for service-based businesses.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">1. General Principles</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">As a service-based business, our work cannot be "returned" like a physical product. Therefore, refunds are considered only when there is a documented failure on our part to meet the agreed-upon project specifications as outlined in the Project Proposal and Service Agreement. All refund considerations will be evaluated in accordance with Hawaii business practices and consumer protection standards.</p>
                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">2. Cancellation and Refund Schedule</h2>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mt-6 mb-3">Pre-Project Cancellation</h3>

                        <p class="text-white font-semibold mb-2">Cancellation Before Work Commences:</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 text-sm">If you wish to cancel a project before any work has started, you may do so by providing written notice. A full refund will be granted, minus a 15% administrative fee to cover initial consultation, proposal drafting, project planning, and administrative costs. This request must be submitted in writing within 15 days of the initial payment.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p class="text-white font-semibold mb-2">Cancellation During the Project:</p>
                        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 text-sm">Once a project has started, cancellation is subject to the work completed at the time of the cancellation request. We will:</p>

                        <li><strong>Technical Impossibility:</strong> If it becomes technically impossible to complete the project as specified through no fault of the client, and alternative solutions are not acceptable.</li>
