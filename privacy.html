      <p>Silva Automation ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website, www.silvaautomation.com (the "Site"), and use our services.</p>

      <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>We may collect information about you in various ways. The information we may collect includes:</p>

      <p><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Personally identifiable information such as your name, company name, email address, telephone number, billing address, and payment information that you voluntarily provide when you fill out a contact form, request a quote, sign a Service Agreement, or otherwise communicate with us.</p>

      <p><strong>Derivative Data:</strong> Information our servers automatically collect when you access the Site, including your IP address, browser type, operating system, access times, pages viewed, referring website, and device information.
