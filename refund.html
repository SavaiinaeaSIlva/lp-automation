       <strong>
        Effective Date:
       </strong>
       August 29, 2025
      </p>
      <p>
       This Refund & Cancellation Policy outlines the conditions under which Silva Automation ("we," "us," or "our") provides refunds and allows for the cancellation of services. This policy applies to all services purchased from us.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white pt-4 mb-4 border-b border-neutral-700 pb-2">
       1. General Principles
      </h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
       <li>
        <strong>
         Transparency and Fairness:
        </strong>
        We are committed to transparency and fairness in all our dealings. Our refund and cancellation terms are designed to protect both our business and your investment.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Service-Based:
        </strong>
        As a service-based business, our work cannot be "returned" like a physical product. Therefore, refunds are considered only when there is a documented failure on our part to meet the agreed-upon project specifications as outlined in the Project Proposal and Service Agreement.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         No Subjective Refunds:
        </strong>
        We will not provide refunds based on subjective opinions of service quality. Refund assessments will be based on objective criteria and the agreed-upon deliverables.
       </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white pt-4 mb-4 border-b border-neutral-700 pb-2">
       2. Cancellation and Refund Schedule
      </h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
       <li>
        <strong>
         Cancellation Before Work Commences:
        </strong>
        If you wish to cancel a project before any work has started, you may do so by providing written notice. A full refund will be granted, minus a 15% administrative fee to cover initial consultation, proposal drafting, and administrative costs. This request must be submitted in writing within 15 days of the initial payment.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Cancellation During the Project:
        </strong>
        Once a project has started, cancellation is subject to the work completed at the time of the cancellation request. We will retain all payments made for work completed up to that point. If a dispute arises over the quality of the work, the resolution process in Section 3 will apply.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Failure to Meet Specifications:
        </strong>
        We guarantee that our deliverables will substantially meet the specifications outlined in the Project Proposal. If you believe we have failed to meet these specifications, you must provide us with written notice detailing the specific issues within thirty (30) days of project completion. We will be given a reasonable opportunity to remedy the issues at no additional cost to you. If, after our remediation efforts, the deliverables still fail to substantially meet the specifications, a partial or full refund may be considered.
       </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white pt-4 mb-4 border-b border-neutral-700 pb-2">
       3. Refund Process
      </h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
       <li>
        <strong>
         Written Request Required:
        </strong>
        All refund requests must be submitted in writing to contact@ssilva.space. The request must include detailed information about the project and the specific issues encountered.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Review and Response:
        </strong>
        We will review your refund request and respond to you in writing within 10 business days.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Processing Refunds:
        </strong>
        If a refund is approved, it will be processed and credited to the original payment method within 14 business days from the date of approval.
       </li>
       <li>
        <strong>
         Cessation of Use:
        </strong>
        Upon receiving a refund for any custom work, you must immediately cease all use of the refunded work product and certify this cessation in writing within 10 business days of the refund. Continued use of the work after a refund has been issued may be considered a violation of our intellectual property rights and may result in legal remedies.
       </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white pt-4 mb-4 border-b border-neutral-700 pb-2">
       4. Exclusions
      </h2>
      <p>
       We will not issue refunds in the following situations:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
       <li>
        Client-Caused Delays: Issues or project failures arising from delays, a lack of timely feedback, or the failure to provide necessary information on your part.
       </li>
       <li>
        Scope Changes: Requests for changes or additions that fall outside the original Project Proposal.
       </li>
       <li>
        Accepted Deliverables: If you have formally accepted deliverables or milestones without raising timely concerns.
       </li>
       <li>
        Third-Party Issues: Factors beyond our control, such as a change in market conditions, changes in regulatory requirements, or disruptions from third-party services (e.g., changes to n8n platform features or pricing).
       </li>
       <li>
        Requests Outside Warranty Period: Refund requests submitted more than thirty (30) days after the project's completion date.
       </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white pt-4 mb-4 border-b border-neutral-700 pb-2">
       5. Dispute Resolution
      </h2>
      <p>
       In the event of a dispute regarding a refund or cancellation, we agree to first attempt to resolve the matter through good-faith negotiation. If a resolution cannot be reached, the dispute will proceed to mediation as outlined in the Service Agreement, with the exclusive jurisdiction in Honolulu County, Hawaii.
      </p>
