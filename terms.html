            <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 24, 2025</p>

            <h2>1. Introduction & Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Silva Automation. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the services, website, and any custom automation systems (collectively, the "Services") provided by Silva Automation ("we," "us," or "our"). By purchasing our services or using our website, you agree to be bound by these Terms in their entirety. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use our Services. Please read them carefully.</p>

            <h2>2. Description of Services</h2>
            <p>Silva Automation provides custom business process automation services. Our packages, including but not limited to the 'Essential Setup' and 'Pro Automation Suite,' involve the design, build-out, and implementation of automation workflows using third-party software applications (e.g., CRMs, scheduling tools, communication platforms). Our service is the intellectual labor and technical skill required to create these systems. You acknowledge that the ongoing functionality of these systems is dependent on the continued operation and terms of these third-party applications.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Fees, Payment, and Refunds</h2>
            <p>All fees for our Services are quoted and due in full prior to the commencement of any work. These fees are for the one-time setup and implementation of your automation systems. You, the client, are solely responsible for any and all ongoing subscription fees for third-party software required to run the automations. Due to the custom nature of our work and the significant time and resources invested upfront, all sales are final and no refunds will be issued once work has commenced.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
            <p>You retain all rights to your pre-existing business data, customer lists, and confidential information. Upon full payment, we grant you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the custom-built automation systems for your internal business operations. We retain ownership of our underlying proprietary processes, methodologies, code snippets, and workflow structures. You may not resell, share, or otherwise distribute the automation systems we build.</p>

            <h2>5. Limitation of Liability & Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p><strong>THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR THAT THEY WILL PRODUCE ANY SPECIFIC RESULT OR RETURN ON INVESTMENT.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>IN NO EVENT SHALL SILVA AUTOMATION BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THE SERVICES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES YOU PAID TO US FOR THE SERVICES IN QUESTION.</strong></p>

            <h2>6. Client Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>To ensure the timely and successful delivery of our Services, you agree to provide all necessary access to third-party accounts, provide required business information, and offer timely feedback and approvals. Delays in providing these items may result in a corresponding delay in the project timeline. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the automation systems complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to data privacy and anti-spam laws.</p>

            <h2>7. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
            <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Hawaii, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, shall be determined by mandatory, binding arbitration in Honolulu, Hawaii. The prevailing party in any such arbitration shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</p>

            <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms on this site. Your continued use of the Services after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>
